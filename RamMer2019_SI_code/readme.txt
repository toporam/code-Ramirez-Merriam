Ramírez: Adapted and extended Alink et al's (2018) published code to facilitate understanding of the content of our letter. The included code exactly replicates Figures 1 & 2b in Ramírez and Merriam (2019).

Two directories are included within the main directory containing this readme.txt file. These two directories contain all the functions and sub-functions needed to replicate our simulations and Figures:

1) RamMer2019_SI_code' is the main directory

1.1) 'Alink_et_al' includes all Matlab functions made available by Alink et al. (2018) (https://osf.io/ph26y/).

1.2) 'RamirezAndMerriam' includes our modifications and extensions of the core functions made available by Alink et al.

Please make sure all three listed directories are in your Matlab path before running the following functions:

mkFigure1.m, mkFigure2fast.m, and/or mkFigure2slow.m

These functions exactly reproduce the simulations and plots shown in Figures 1 and 2b of our letter. For further details, please see the Supplementary Information file accompanying our letter, as well as the 'readme.txt' file by Alink et al. included in the sub-directory 'Alink_et_al'.
